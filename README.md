# MercuryModder
Lets you mod your fridge in a much easier way.

This tool works with the assumption that you have two copies of your game - a clean one and a "dirty" (modded one). It uses the clean copy as a template to produce files which are then written over the "dirty" version. You probably want to check out [the guide](./GUIDE.md)

The tool was tested under Linux, should work under Windows as well.

Big thanks to everyone in that one Discord server for all the help when writing and debugging this and numerous other things.
